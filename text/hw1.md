1. 4+4 = 1
   3x5 = 1
   3^-1 = 4
2. Yes, because each element has an inverse, and the group is closed by the operation, and we have identity element, and the operation is associative.
3. -13 mod 5 = 2
4. degree of polynomial is 3
   The polynomial evaluates to 0 at x = 2, so x = 2 is a root of the polynomial.
